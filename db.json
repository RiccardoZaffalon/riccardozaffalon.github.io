Sometimes you may want to know whether a series is returning or it has ended, or how many seasons it has. But you know that if you are going to search for that on the web, you could run into other information that you don't want or need.So I built a small application that solves that.\n\n![Shows Stack](/images/work/shows-stack.png)\n\nI knew I wanted a single page application that could feel quick and minimalistic, so I built it using React and React Router. I wrote much of the code with ES6 syntax, JSX components and Sass, using Babel and Webpack to compile and build it.\n\n![Shows Code](/images/work/shows-code.jpg)\n\n## Home and Search page\n\n![Shows Home](/images/work/shows-home.jpg)\n\n## Show detail page\n\n![Show Detail](/images/work/shows-show.jpg)\n\nSee?

      "content": "![Youtube Home](/images/work/youtube-home.png)\n\n## Why\nWhen I browse a new Youtube channel, I often go straight to the most popular videos they released until then, to find their **best content**. The problem is that *Youtube displays all the most viewed videos since the channel was created*, and that is not always relevant or ideal for me. I want to be able to **filter their content more finely**, for example to only see the **most popular videos released in the past month**, or year.\n\n## What\nSo on a rainy Sunday afternoon, I went through Youtube API's documentantion, quickly prototyped, and built a small application – optimized for the desktop experience – to do exactly that. Now I can search for a Youtube channel's name or description, grab its ID, apply **query and date filters**, and search for the most popular content that I am interested in.\n\n![Youtube Channel](/images/work/youtube-channel.png)\n\n## How\nTo optimize *speed of development and performance*, I built the application using modern JavaScript techniques, such as **Promises**, **fetch**, and **ES6** syntax.\n\nI utilized **moment.js** to manipulate time and date information, and **Handlebars** to build semantic templates and render the search results; everything else is **Vanilla JS**.\n\nThe CSS was written in **Sass** and compiled with **Gulp**.\n\n![Youtube Code](/images/work/youtube-code.png)\n\nAs this is an open source project, you can read or download the code on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RiccardoZaffalon/youtube-custom-search).\n"

All the pages were then individually designed in Sketch both in a desktop and a mobile context, and all the interactive elements prototyped.\n\nTo provide ease of content editing and data entry for the client, the website was then developed as a responsive custom WordPress solution, leveraging the flexibility of custom post types, taxonomies and fields, while keeping in mind search engine friendliness and performance.\n\n> “Riccardo did a fantastic job, I look forward to working with him in the future.”\n> \n> Tyler Benoit — Chief Creative Officer & President at BENMEDIA\n\n## Home Page\n\n![BENMEDIA Home](/images/work/ben-home.png)\n\n## Services Page\n\n![BENMEDIA Services](/images/work/ben-services.png)"
