Based in Treviso (Italy), since the beginning of **2018** I have been at [alpenite](//www.alpenite.com), where I work as a **Senior Consultant** on web projects. Here I have had the opportunity to lead the frontend development of ecommerce websites for several fashion brands, including [Bulgari](https://www.bulgari.com), [Fendi](https://www.fendi.com/), [Stella McCartney](https://www.stellamccartney.com/), [Liu Jo](//www.liujo.com), [Pinko](//www.pinko.com), [Tezenis](//www.tezenis.com), [Intimissimi](//www.intimissimi.com), and more.

Besides these projects, my main focuses are introducing **new helpful technologies** to streamline my teamâ€™s work, and **mentoring junior colleagues**, to help them grow and bring increasingly more value to the company.

Previously, I have lived in beautiful **Vancouver, British Columbia**, and worked as a freelancer for clients in Italy and Canada, providing digital solutions for small business owners and professionals since **2016**.
